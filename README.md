# WPF Calendar Application

A comprehensive software application designed to deliver an intuitive graphical user interface for efficient viewing and management of events and appointments. This project was a collaborative effort undertaken by my colleague and me during our Program III class, where we delved into advanced concepts of software development using C# and XAML. This experience provided a valuable opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, emphasizing effective communication and seamless integration of back-end and front-end components.

Our application not only excels in providing a user-friendly interface but also boasts robust functionality, catering to diverse scheduling needs. The integration of C# and XAML allowed us to create a seamless and responsive experience for users. The development process sharpened our skills, deepening our understanding of the intricacies involved in creating cohesive software.

## Notable Features

One notable feature of our application is the implementation of a comprehensive monthly report system. This addition enhances the utility of the software by enabling users to generate and analyze monthly reports, providing insights into their scheduling patterns and enhancing their overall organizational efficiency. The incorporation of this reporting feature reflects our commitment to delivering a holistic solution that goes beyond basic event management, making our application a versatile and powerful tool for users across various domains.Our application also allows you to load and save your agenda, ensuring that your schedule is easily accessible and can be backed up for future use.
